# linkedlist_queue

This only works for integers

**Queue** is a first-in first-out data structure. This queue uses a doubly linked list, where each node has a previous node and a next node. A queue can:
- add (add a node to the back of the queue)
- remove (remove a node from the front of the queue and return its value)
- peek (return the value of the front of the queue)
